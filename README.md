# Machine-Learning-Sentence-Classification
The primary objective of this project is to develop a robust machine-learning model capable of accurately classifying sentences from job descriptions into predefined categories. By breaking down the job description into smaller, more manageable parts, this model aims to facilitate better decision-making in the recruitment process.
